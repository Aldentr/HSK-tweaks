# HSK-tweaks
HSK tweaks for personal use

Core_SK_Patch:
1. Patch chances to instant destroy ammo while looting to "0  + modificator from difficulty" (default: 0.09 + mod. from dif.).
2. Patch chances to instant destroy item (weapon) while looting to "0  + modificator from difficulty" (default: 0.04 + mod. from dif.).
3. Patch chances to damage looted item by deterioration to "0  + modificator from difficulty" (default: 0.25 + mod. from dif.).
4. Change all lighting power consumption (4-14 W depending on lightning type).

Roads_of_the_Rim_HSK_Patch (you need "Roads of the Rim" mod from Steam for this file to work [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613783924&searchtext=roads]):
1. Add "Roads of the Rim" mod compatibility (change costs according to HSK materials).
2. If you you are not using this mod it will add Concrete bridge from mod to HSK (some bridge stats: terrain affodrnance up to Heavy, possibility to construct on Deep water).

SRTS_Expanded_HSK_ Patch (you need "SRTS Expanded" mod from Steam for this file to work [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845423808&searchtext=srts] and, optional, "SRTS Expanded: RotorCraft" [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845423808&searchtext=srts]):
1. Small changes to research prerequisites for some ships for both mods. If you use both mods, ships from SRTSE will require researches from SRTS: RC.
2. Change costs of ships according to HSK materials (there is a bug when ship material changes to default "Steel", i will try to adress this issue to authors of SRTSE).
3. I didn't touch bombing and power generation features (i asked authors of SRTSE to do those optional, they promiced to do smthg right after their programmer will finish working on new mod. And, as i saw on Combat Extented GitHub, CE team received request to patch SRTSE for CE compitabilty, so it's only matter of time). If it is crucial, i can delete those features from mod, but i don't like only method, that i have for this (deleting corresponding strings in xml files).
